This is a pretty ambitious project... My goal for the next 3 years (4 with honours ðŸ‘€) is to document my entire math degree journey in this single repo. Every lecture, tutorial, assignment. All my notetaking, will be captured in this repo. My dream is, that at the end of it all, I'll be able to complie these notes into a book, which I'll distribute to close friends, family, and anyone else who helped me along the way, as a graduation gift.

Along the way, I think I'll develop some nifty tools to help me in this process!

Finally, I'm starting off with Charlie's Math Template ([CMT](https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template)) which offers some beautiful LaTeX code. I'll certainly make my own changes and additions to suit it to my needs over time.

I am so happy and thankful to finally be studying Math at the University of Queensland. It's been a long and crazy journey to get here. I will not let the opportunty go to waste!

# Ideas/TODO:

- Can I have my lecturers/tutors sign my repo somehow?
- UQ auto generated academic transcript to tex complier
- course_notes_format.tex to book_format.tex formatter/processing tool
